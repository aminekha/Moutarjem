# Moutarjem
Moutarjem (an arabic word that means "Translator") is the first deep learning program in the world that can translate your voice to any language with keeping your voice.

So you will be able to do any discussion with anyone in the world each with his language, and Moutarjem will translate your talks keeping your original voices.

I Need:
- Speech Recognition
- Translating words
- Imitating voice (deep voice)
